# The "James" Portfolio (A.K.A. The Bloat Experiment)

### "I could have done this in 1k+ lines of HTML + CSS... but here we are."

## The "Why"

Look, if it were up to me, I’d be writing **raw-dog HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS** while drinking black coffee. I generally think most frameworks are just unnecessary bloatware that slows down my precious CPU cycles.

**So, why did I use a stack?**
This was a school project, so I don't have really much of a choice. I realized that while I love optimization, I also like things that look pretty and don't take 3 years to build. This project is my "truce" with modern web dev.

**What I learned:**

* **Dev Speed > Ego:** Sometimes shipping matters more than having the smallest bundle size in the world.
* **UI/UX matters:** Shadcn makes things look "pro" faster than I can write custom CSS variables.
* **3D is cool:** Three.js does things that raw DOM elements simply cannot do without making me cry.

## Choose Your Fighter: The Two Modes

I couldn't decide between "Fast & Clean" and "Flashy & Heavy," so I built both.

### 🛠️ Dev Mode (For the Recruiters)

This is the "Get to the point" mode. It’s fast, it’s clean, and it won't make your laptop fans sound like a jet engine. Perfect for people who just want to see if I can actually code.

### Creative Mode (For the Vibes)

This is the 3D version. It’s experimental, it’s shiny, and it uses **Three.js**.

> **Mobile Users Beware:** 3D on a phone is like trying to run Crysis on a calculator. If it lags, just know it’s because your phone is scared of these polygons. Switch back to Dev Mode if things get spicy.

## The "Bloat" Stack (The Tools I Used)

I used these packages because, apparently, "efficiency" also means "not reinventing the wheel every Tuesday."

* **Next.js / React:** Because everyone else is using it and it's actually kind of fast.
* **Three.js (R3F):** To make things spin and look 3D without writing 5,000 lines of WebGL.
* **Shadcn/UI:** Pre-made components so I didn't have to spend 4 hours centering a div.
* **Tailwind:** Because writing CSS classes in my HTML feels wrong, but it works so well.

### 🎓 The School Project Bit

Built this for school to prove I can play nice with modern frameworks while still obsessing over performance. It’s a bridge between my "Vanilla JS" soul and my "Next.js" reality—proving that I can make websites beautiful if I want to, even if I generally prefer speed and optimization.
